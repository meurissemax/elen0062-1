\section{Fingerprints}\label{sec:fingerprint}
Feature engineering is the process by which we use knowledge about the problem we face (here, the ability for a chemical compound to inhibit HIV replication) in order to create features that make machine learning efficient. As no member of the group had any knowledge about the domain, we relied on the RDKit library for Python. Given in that library are several fingerprinting methods, which identify and hash topological paths in molecules and use them to set bits in a fingerprints of user-specified lengths (taken from the RDKit documentation).

As explained in the introduction, we tried \textit{Morgan}, \textit{RDKFingerprint}, \textit{Avalon} and \textit{MACCS} fingerprints. Although we started using different fingerprints late in the challenge, we had time to test them on some submissions and found out that, in these tests, \textit{Morgan} provided better results, although the variation in scores was not very high. However, when comparing the scores obtained on the private leaderboard, it was clear that \textit{MACCS} performed better, leading to \num{0.05} increase in most models in which it had been tested, while the models tested with \textit{Morgan} that performed well on the public leaderboard provided worse results in general in the private one. This may come from the fact that the dataset used for the public leaderboard was not very representative of the whole dataset.

When testing a model (a consensus model containing KNN, MLP, SVM and RFC) with \textit{Avalon} and \num{512} bits for the fingerprinting, we reached a public score of \num{0.7564} and a private score of \num{0.8116}. Testing the same submission and only changing \textit{avalon} with \textit{Morgan} gives us a public score of \num{0.7678} and a private one of \num{0.7950}. We can see that \textit{Morgan} performed better on the \og{}public dataset\fg{}, all other things being equal, and worse on the private one than \textit{avalon}. As we based our iterative search for the best model partly on the score obtained on the public leaderboard, this is the reason we stuck with \textit{Morgan}, although the estimated AUC was almost \num{0.02} less for \textit{Morgan}.
